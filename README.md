# team-generator

This is a software engineering team generator CLI app that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. This application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of a manager, engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, this application will create an HTML file that displays a formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
